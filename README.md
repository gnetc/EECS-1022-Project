Tic Tac Toe 

The project we have chosen is Tic Tac Toe. The game consists of two players that take turns to put the symbol X or O that is assigned to them on a 3x3 grid. The materials required to play this game include just a pencil and paper. Tic Tac Toe may seem like a simple game, but it does require the person to strategize, and they may need to think about their next move. We plan on having features such as player vs player and player vs computer integrated into our mobile  application.  The aim of the project is to use Java to make an interactive game that will follow the conditions (rules); for example, players take turns to place symbols X or O. 

Rules: 
- The game is played on a grid that is 3 by 3 square. 
- The game must meet the requirement of having only two players.
- The game must consist of only two symbols; either an X or an O.
- The two players must take turns until the game is over. 
- Players must only fill an empty square, not a square that is taken.
- The player to first get a row of their symbol is the winner. (up, down, across, or diagonally)
- If all of the nine squares are filled, and there are no three symbols in a row, that concludes that the game is a tie. 

We plan on creating a mobile application of digital Tic Tac Toe using the Software development life cycle Model to aid us. The technologies we will be using are Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA to implement the components needed in this project. The emulator available in Android Studio will immensely assist us in perfecting and analyzing the behavior of our User Interface. It allows us to see our design phase come to life in real-time as it will enable us to see what the app looks like and can also help us in testing. We will be using other features also to test, such as Java Unit testing. The project work will be equally distributed among all four members of the team. 

Functional Requirements:

1. The Users will be presented first with a menu on the landing screen using android Studio, in which they can choose to play against another player or have another option which is to play against a CPU.
2. The game has a capped number which is 2. Only two players or a singular player  will be able to play this game. 
3. The game Tic-Tac-Toe will be using traditional symbols X and O to mark positions of the player's desired square on the grid and the players must take turns to conclude the result of the game.
4. The users are presented with a grid that is empty and will be filled with graphics as the user plays. The positioning of the symbols X and O will be placed inside one square of the grid (centered) and another player is not able to use that square space. 
5. A player is declared a winner if their respective symbols have three in a row on the grid either up, down, across, or diagonally.
6. If all of the nine squares are filled, and there are no three symbols in a row, that concludes that the game is a tie and a banner saying tie pop up. 
7. Once a player wins a winner banner pops up congratulating the winning player and a “better luck next time” to the losing player.
8. A player is declared a winner if their respective symbols have three in a row on the grid either up, down, across, or diagonally.
9. If all of the nine squares are filled, and there are no three symbols in a row, that concludes that the game is a tie and a banner saying “Tie” will pop up. 
10. Once a player wins a winner banner pops up congratulating the winning player and a “Better luck next time” to the losing player.
11. Following the “Better luck next time” screen, the player will be given an option to retry or quit the game making them come back to the menu landing screen.
