Tic Tac Toe 

The project we have chosen is Tic Tac Toe. The game consists of two players that take turns to put the symbol X or O that is assigned to them on a 3x3 grid. The materials required to play this game include just a pencil and paper. Tic Tac Toe may seem like a simple game, but it does require the person to strategize, and they may need to think about their next move. We plan on having features such as player vs player and player vs computer integrated into our mobile  application.  The aim of the project is to use Java to make an interactive game that will follow the conditions (rules); for example, players take turns to place symbols X or O. 

Rules: 
The game is played on a grid that is 3 by 3 square. 
The game must meet the requirement of having only two players.
The game must consist of only two symbols; either an X or an O.
The two players must take turns until the game is over. 
Players must only fill an empty square, not a square that is taken.
The player to first get a row of their symbol is the winner. (up, down, across, or diagonally)
If all of the nine squares are filled, and there are no three symbols in a row, that concludes that the game is a tie. 

We plan on creating a mobile application of digital Tic Tac Toe using the Software development life cycle Model to aid us. The technologies we will be using are Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA to implement the components needed in this project. The emulator available in Android Studio will immensely assist us in perfecting and analyzing the behavior of our User Interface. It allows us to see our design phase come to life in real-time as it will enable us to see what the app looks like and can also help us in testing. We will be using other features also to test, such as Java Unit testing. The project work will be equally distributed among all four members of the team.
